## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - React framework
- [Framer Motion](https://framer.com/motion/) - For Animation

### What I learned

This is by far the Hardest Challenge I take. And boy I learned **a lot**. CSS position, how to read documentation, Animating with React Library like Framer Motion, and many more.

The most challenging about this project is (of course) the navigation. It's ~~a bit~~ messy but I could somehow made it work. Well, the animation for mobile navigation isn't that great but for the first time using framer motion, I'll take it.

Oh, and finally I could use gh-pages to push a website into github pages.

### Continued development

I really like to learn about Framer Motion and React components more.
